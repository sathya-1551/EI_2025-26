# Facade Pattern - Online Store System  

## Use Case  
An *e-commerce order placement system* that simplifies the complex interactions between inventory, payment, and shipping subsystems into a single unified interface.  

---

## What It Solves  
- Hides complexity of multiple subsystems  
- Provides simple interface for complex operations  
- Reduces client dependencies on subsystem classes  
- Makes the system easier to use and understand  

---

## Classes  

### ðŸ”¹ Inventory  
Subsystem for stock management.  
- `checkStock(String product)` â†’ Verifies product availability  

### ðŸ”¹ Payment  
Subsystem for payment processing.  
- `makePayment(String product)` â†’ Processes payment transaction  

### ðŸ”¹ Shipping  
Subsystem for product delivery.  
- `shipProduct(String product)` â†’ Handles product shipment  

### ðŸ”¹ OnlineStoreFacade  
Facade that coordinates all subsystems.  
- Initializes all subsystem instances  
- `placeOrder(String product)` â†’ Orchestrates complete order workflow (check stock â†’ process payment â†’ ship product)  

### ðŸ”¹ Main  
Demonstrates facade pattern by placing an order through simplified interface without directly interacting with subsystems.
