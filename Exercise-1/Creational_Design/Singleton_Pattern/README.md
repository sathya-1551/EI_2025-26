# Singleton Pattern - TV Remote  

## Use Case  
A *TV remote control system* where only one remote instance should exist to control a single TV, preventing multiple conflicting remote objects.  

---

## What It Solves  
- Prevents creation of multiple remote control instances  
- Ensures global access to a single remote object  
- Avoids conflicting commands from multiple remote instances  
- Thread-safe remote control management

## Classes

### ðŸ”¹ Main  
Demonstrates singleton behaviour by creating two references to the same remote instance.
