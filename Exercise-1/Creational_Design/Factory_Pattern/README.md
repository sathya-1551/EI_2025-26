# Factory Method Pattern - Car Manufacturing  

## Use Case  
A *car manufacturing system* that produces different types of vehicles (*Sedan, SUV*) through their respective factories, following a standardized production process.  

---

## What It Solves  
- Decouples car creation logic from client code  
- Allows adding new car types without modifying existing code  
- Standardizes manufacturing process across all car types  
- Makes the system extensible for future car models

## Classes  

### ðŸ”¹ Car (Interface)  
Defines the manufacturing contract with methods:  
- `design()` â†’ Design phase  
- `manufacture()` â†’ Manufacturing phase  
- `qualityCheck()` â†’ Quality control phase  
- `deliver()` â†’ Delivery phase  

### ðŸ”¹ Sedan  
Implements **Car** interface for sedan-type vehicles with *rooftop* and *power engine*.  

### ðŸ”¹ SUV  
Implements **Car** interface for SUV-type vehicles with *AI assistant* and *electric engine*.  

### ðŸ”¹ CarFactory (Interface)  
Defines factory contract with `createCar()` method.  

### ðŸ”¹ SedanFactory  
Creates and returns **Sedan** objects.  

### ðŸ”¹ SUVFactory  
Creates and returns **SUV** objects.  

### ðŸ”¹ Main  
Demonstrates the factory pattern by creating different car types through their respective factories.
